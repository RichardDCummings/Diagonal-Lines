# Diagonal-Lines
WHAT IS DIAGONAL LINES?
Diagonal Lines is a program made by Richard D. Cummings, though that’s just an alias ya big dumb dumb. It draws multiple diagonal lines of various colors, with only one thickness, as well as an optional thin black line in between each color (on by default).



WHAT IS IT FOR?
It’s mostly for experimentation with what I am capable to do with code, though it could potentially be used to design all sorts of things from wallpapers, to YouTube thumbnails, to profile pictures.



HOW DO I USE IT/WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS?
To use this software you must have AT LEAST python 3.6 OR HIGHER installed to run the program.

Instructions on editing the code in #comments in program.



EXTRA SOFTWARE YOU MIGHT LIKE TO USE FOR DESIGN PURPOSES - GIMP.
I wouldn’t recommend this software if all you want to do is test/experiment with my program. But if you want you can use this to create a unique wallpaper, YouTube thumbnail, background, and/or profile picture.
The software I would personally recommend to do these things is called gimp seeing as it is a free alternative to photo shop and would go great with my program for designing purposes.

HAPPY CODING!
